Web scraping can become handy and easy with tools such as Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium. Each of these tools has it's own application. While Scrapy is the tool for complex projects, BeautifulSoup is used for smaller tasks. Selenium is used for Javascript featured websites â€“ and can be used as a standalone web scraper and parser.
